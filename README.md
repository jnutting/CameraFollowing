CameraFollowing
-----

This is a small example project created for the purpose of demonstrating
some ways to make a camera follow a player in an interesting way. Open
this project in Unity3D 5.0 or later to see how it works.

The project contains a series of scenes, each with a slightly more
complex camera movement controller script than the previous. Hopefully
someone will find this useful.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome!
